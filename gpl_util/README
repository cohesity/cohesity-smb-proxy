This directory contains all our code that needs to link to some GPL open source
libraries. We keep this separate from other directories to contain the GPL
usage. All C/C++ source files in this directory should be under GPL license.

Currently we have one concrete example, which is our SMB proxy, that links and
uses the SAMBA library to fetch extended SMB ACLs from an SMB v2 or v3 server.
This proxy uses gRPC as the communication method.

Please do not include files or link to libraries in this directory from outside.
